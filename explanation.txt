<DragDropContext> -> where we can drag and drop

<Droppable> -> area where we can drop 

<Draggable> -> Individual components which can be dragged.


for droppable we pass (provided) and the div must refer to {provided.innerRef}
for draggable we pass ref={provided.innerRef}
                    {...provided.dragHandleProps}
                    {...provided.draggableProps}


<DragDropContext>
    <Droppable "app">
        <Draggable List1>
            <Droppable "List1">
                <Draggable Card1>
                </Draggable Card1>
            <Droppable "List1">
        </Draggable List1>
        <Draggable List2>
            <Droppable "List2">
            <Droppable "List2">
        </Draggable List2>
        <Draggable List3>
            <Droppable "List3">
            <Droppable "List3">
        </Draggable List3>
    </Droppable>
</DragDropContext>



Every Logic has to go in onDragEnd

It will pass result as an argument

the result will have 
    1) source -> {index, droppableID}
    2) destination -> {index, droppableID} 
    3) DraggableID
    4) Type and anyother props passed for Droppable.

with the help of this, we must frame our logic.

The DIV referencing provided.innerRef must end with {provided.placeholder} so that the droppable area just stops there.
